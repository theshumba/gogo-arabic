# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-08)

**Core value:** Players naturally learn Arabic through guided exploration and interaction in an engaging RPG world — never wondering "what should I do next?" or "how do I practice?"
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Critical Fixes

## Current Position

Last activity: 2026-02-08 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (z-index tokens + review badge)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10% (1/10 Phase 1 tasks complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 - Critical Fixes | 1/2 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- CSS Modules for new components (consistency, responsive breakpoints, accessibility)
- useFocusTrap for all overlays (WCAG AA compliance, hook already exists)
- Phaser DOMOverlay for NPC markers (existing system, minimal overhead)
- Revised v2.0 to prioritize player-facing features (cut Architecture, Testing, Backend phases to v3.0)
- Added 5 new player-facing phases: Daily Dashboard, World Map Upgrade, Player Profile, Visual Polish, Outfit System
- Outfit sprites to be AI-generated
- Bundle splitting (PERF-01) folded into Phase 4 (Onboarding & HUD)

**From 01-01 execution:**
- Set --z-pause-menu to 200 (overlay tier) instead of 50 - pause menu is functionally a full-screen overlay
- Top-level z-index tokens only (internal component z-index stays literal) - prevents over-engineering
- EventBus pattern for review navigation (consistent with existing alphabet/map patterns)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phases 8-9 (Visual Polish, Outfits) depend on pixel art assets — AI generation quality TBD
